                <p>Peter O. Dickinson, 22 of Surry, The pride and joy of Mark O and Susan E Dickinson, died on July 1, 2013 from the result of a car accident. He was taken home by
                angels where he can live in peace with no worries.</p>
                <p>Peter was born on February 7th, 1991 in Augusta, ME.During Peter’s short stay on earth, he touched hundreds of lives in a positive and meaningful way. Peter made friends easily. He was a highly gifted athlete, especially as a pitcher in baseball, which was his first love. He had the opportunity to play championship games with the Surry Tigers, Coastal Little League, Junior and Senior League and the George Stevens Academy Eagles.</p>
                <p>Peter was an avid and naturally talented fisherman. Peter could find a way to catch a bass out of a bucket of water on the lawn. He loved the outdoors, East Grand Lake, Alaska, and many other lakes and ponds in Maine. As a young man Peter always dreamed of being a starting pitcher for the Red Sox then after that he was going to be a bass pro fisherman.
                Peter had a great and goofy sense of humor, his smile lit up the world. He tried very hard to be a good and helpful friend. He always had words of encouragement for others, even during times when it was Pete who desperately needed help.</p>
                <p>Peter was predeceased by his Grandfather & Grandmother Ray O Dickinson and Pedita Dickinson, Grandfather George R Walton Sr., and Aunt Shirley Dickinson
                He will be sorely missed by Mom and Dad, Mark O and Susan E Dickinson, Peter’s dog “Sally”, Grandmother Jeanette E.Walton, Aunts and Uncles, Caryl and Carroll Adams, Alberta and Mitch Cole, David Dickinson , Fred & Kay Dickinson. George and Linda Walton, Elsie J Cough and special friend David, Bruce and Donna Walton. Special Cousins Adam & Emily Walton. Special Foster Parents Mike and Gina Jewett and family. Many cousins, all of his former teammates and coaches over the years.
                Peter left behind another family that few of us knew, they were always on his mind. Peter always spoke of his concern for his birth family. They are Birth-Mother Rose, his sisters Amber, Alisha and Marie, Uncle & Aunt Kevin & Lynn and Uncle Gary.</p>
                <p>There will be a Celebration of Peter’s life, on Saturday, July 13, 2013 at 2:00 PM - at the GSA Baseball field. Adoptive family and friends are invited to attend.</p>
                <p>In lieu of flowers, we think that Peter’s spirit will be very grateful if folks would donate to the Peter Dickinson GSA Baseball Fund to be used to build a permanent location for the baseball concession stand and any other improvements needed for the baseball field that Coach Kane and Coach Gray deem necessary. Peter loved that place more than any other.</p>

            <h3 id="letter-mom" class="eheader">Dear Petah</h3>
            <section class="eul">
                <p>I remember the first day I took you to school at The Surry Elementary School; I was so scared for you. You held my hand so tight as we walked through that door, you too were very scared as well. I promised I would sit outside the door of your classroom as long as you needed me. I sat there and cried. (I think Mrs. Farley thought I was being over protective) I thought at the time that it was the hardest thing that a parent has to do. Since then I have learned, that was just a stepping stone.</p>
                <p>You taught me so much, and opened my eyes to a world I was never aware of. I remember the early years; you had so many fears for such a young boy. But you were growing every day, you learned to sleep with the light off and door closed. The bad people in your dreams went away gradually as you were growing each year.</p>
                <p>I will always remember when you were 10 years old and you had just made the Little League Team in Surry, You were so happy! A few days later you asked Dad and I if you would be able to play in the games, and I said “why do you ask?” You responded “ in foster care I went to the practices but had to miss the games because I had to go to respite on weekends”. Mark and I started to water up and responded of course you can play in the games because there will no longer be respite. That opened up my eyes on how many challenges you’ve already gone through as a young man.</p>
                <p>After that I was determined for you never to miss a practice or game. Which I don’t think you ever did unless of course you broke a leg or something!</p>
                <p>I was so happy for you when you started getting taller and gaining weight. You were always concerned you weren’t every going to be able to sit in the front seat of the van. You had to weigh 100 lbs and be a certain height. You were so happy when that happened. We will never remove you height chart on our wall as I loved watching the marks get higher on the wall because I knew it meant so much to you.</p>
                <p>You loved your food... always cooked a certain way for Petah... Toasted egg sandwich – extra crispy toast with sharp cheese or a Toasted cheese with sharp cheddar – extra crispy... always your comfort foods. If you could have one of those and a LARGE glass of milk before each game you were the happiest kid in the world. Then after every game you always wanted PIZZA – Pepperoni with extra cheese and extra crispy...</p>
                <p>I want you to know I loved doing all the stuff we did all those summers we were home together, trips to long pond cliff rocks, swimming hole, over to the Haass’s camp @ chunk a pork rock, Flanders pond, wiffle ball, soccer and baseball clinics. If you could think it, I would figure out a way we do most everything you wanted. Dad and I decided
                long before you came into our lives that I would stay home as much as I could to work only Peter’s hours. So that gave me time to share many hours with you I will never forget. It seems like yesterday that we had Ross, Emily, Casey, Shawn, Chase, Adam, Garrett, Charlie, Joey, Nicky and many more at the house or pick up to take somewhere. We were always moving. I loved every bit of it. I wish I could bring those days back.</p>
                <p>God gave us you for such a short time, and I will always remember you. I believe God has work for you to do, I’m not sure what, I bet you’ll have time to play the games you love, and fish and hunt, you’ve always loved the outdoors. You’re at peace now with no more worries. Say hi to Grampie for me. (I’m kind of sure he gave you a small lecture when you first arrived, He loves you so much!)
                Keep smiling as that is how I will always remember you.</p> 
                <p>Love you with all my heart, </p>
                <p>MOM
